# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Wally understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a business associate, Wally is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Wally has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Wally Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Wally Customers have data stored by Wally as a part of the Wally Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Wally.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Wally within 30 days, Wally removes data from Wally systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
