# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Wally understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a business associate, Wally is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Wally has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for covered entities to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws
