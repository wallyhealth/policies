## 19.3 Issue Escalation

Security incidents, particularly those involving ePHI, are handled using the process described in [§11.2](#11.2-incident-management-policies). If the incident involves a breach of ePHI, the Security Officer, or designated personnel, will manage the incident using the process described in [§12.2](#12.2-wally-breach-policy). Refer to [§11.2](#11.2-incident-management-policies) for a list of sample items that can trigger Wally's incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether the issue is a security incident, contact the Security Officer immediately.

It is the duty of that owner to follow the process outlined below:

1. Create a ticket in the Wally QMS.
2. The ticket is investigated and documented.
3. When a conclusion or remediation is reached, it is marked as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
4. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome.
