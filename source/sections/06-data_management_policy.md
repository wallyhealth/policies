# 6. Data Management Policy

Wally has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI). The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by Wally.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Wally. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for Wally and Wally Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
