# Y. Vendor Management Policy

This policy and supporting procedures are designed to provide Wally with a documented and formalized Vendor Management policy that is to be adhered to and utilized throughout the organization at all times. Compliance with the stated policy and supporting procedures helps ensure the overall confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the organization’s networks.

## Y.1 Vendor Selection

### Y.1.1 Vendor Assessment Analysis

Wally’s vendor assessment analysis is to comprehensively assess each organization in regards to the risk areas outlined in [§Y.2 Vendor Risk Assessment](#Y.2-vendor-risk-assessment), which include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Identify all 3rd party outsourcing organizations.
* Obtain all contractual documents and other supporting documentation for helping assess 3rd party services. This may also include legal correspondence, audited financial statements, various expenses and revenues directly tied to such providers, etc.
* Obtain all regulatory compliance reports. This may include assessment such as SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO, and many other compliance mandates and reports.
* Identify, review, and assess any consumer complaints, unethical business practices, etc.
* Identify, review, and assess any data security breaches, cyber security attacks, etc.
* Identify if any 3rd parties are storing, processing, and/or transmitting any sensitive and confidential information, commonly known as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and any derivative thereof.
* Identify, review and asses all operational, business specific, and information security policies, procedures, and practices relevant to services being provided to Wally, particularly documentation pertaining to incident response, security awareness, business continuity and disaster recovery planning.
* All other measures deemed necessary by Wally.

### Y.1.2 Due Diligence in Vendor Selection

The selection process for new vendors is to consist of exhaustive measures for ensuring all relevant aforementioned risk areas have been thoroughly assessed by Wally, which is to include, but not limited to, the following measures:

* Review of all regulatory compliance and operational audits and assessments, etc.
* Experience and overall business “know-how”.
* Operational capacity and scalability.
* Use of other 3rd parties by the actual vendors themselves.
* Reputation within the industry and from the general public.
* Inquiry into any past, present or expected legal issues, constraints, or concerns.
* Alignment of vision, strategies, and overall goals with each organization.
* Assessment of operational, business specific, and information security policies, procedures, and practices, particularly documentation pertaining to incident response, security awareness, business continuity and disaster recovery planning.
* Assessment of organization-wide system of internal controls.

### Y.1.3 Contractual Documentation

Once vendors have been selected for providing critical outsourcing services to Wally, the following procedures are to be undertaken regarding all contractual documentation:

* A formalized and written contract has been produced, one that dutifully identifies roles, responsibilities, obligations, and expectations from all relevant parties.
* The contract has been approved by Wally officers. This also requires addressing the following issues regarding stakeholders:
  * Are they aware of the risks when entering contractual agreements with such vendors?
  * Are there any financial relationships or associations with such vendors?
  * Were all due diligence findings and documentation presented clearly and in a timely manner to such individuals?
* Comprehensive and appropriate review undertaken by legal-council, with all issues, constraints, and concerns addressed as necessary.
* Defined operational, performance, and other necessary baseline standards for services to be performed, along with reporting metrics on such issues, such as daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
* Fees paid for stated services along with other financial considerations.
* Regulatory compliance audits and mandates, such as annual financial statement audits, annual operational and security assessments, etc.
* Numerous other legal issues, including, but not limited to, the following: resolution measures, indemnification, continuation of services, intellectual property.

## Y.2 Vendor Risk Assessment

When using 3rd party services, a certain element of risk arises as responsibilities for critical initiatives are now in the hands of another organization. It's important to understand these risks, and how Wally can readily identify any issues, concerns, or constraints pertaining to these risks. Failure to mitigate and prevent these risks can result in significant financial loss, legal issues, and public opinion misconceptions, ultimately damaging the organization. 

## Y.2.1 Vendor Risk Identification

The following risks are to be thoroughly understood and assessed in regard to business and contractual relationships entered into with various 3rd parties.

1. Compliance Risk. These are risks arising from violations of applicable laws, rules, regulatory mandates, and along with other issues, such as non-compliance of internal operational, business specific, and information security policies, procedures and processes. Regulatory compliance is a large and critically important component of vendor management, requiring constant monitoring and oversight of 3rd parties for ultimately ensuring the safety and security of services being provided to Wally as such entities. Common compliance initiatives for which 3rd parties are to adhere to including numerous laws, legislative mandates, and industry specific requirements, including, but not limited to, the following: HIPAA, HITECH, SOC 2, PCI DSS.
2. Reputation Risk. These are risks arising from negative public perception and opinion of a 3rd party entity for almost any imaginable reason, such as unethical business practices, data breaches resulting in loss of sensitive and confidential consumer information, investigations from regulators into questionable business practices, etc.
3. Strategic Risk. These are risks arising from 3rd parties failing to implement business initiatives that align with the overall goals and ideas of Wally, such as not offering services that provide an acceptable return on investment, both short term and long term. Ultimately, when the long term strategic vision of both Wally and the applicable 3rd party outsourcing entities do not align, relevant risks begin to surface which can significantly impact the business relationship, often in a negative manner.
4. Operational Risk. These are risks arising from a failed system of operational internal controls relating to relevant policies, procedures, processes, and practices. When integrating daily operational activities with a 3rd party, a breakdown on the 3rd party side can seriously impact the organization, ultimately affecting productivity, workflow efficiency, etc.
5. Transaction Risk. These are risks arising from a 3rd party failing to deliver products or services as promised, such as operational efficiency, or worse, unauthorized transactions and theft of information due to a weak system of internal security controls.
6. Credit Risk. These are risks arising from the financial condition of the 3rd party, such as a business that functions without the threat of liquidation for the foreseeable future, usually regarded as at least within 12 months. A ceasing of operations because of credit risks can seriously impact Wally in many ways.
6. Country Risk. These are risks arriving from the politic, economic, and social landscape, and other relevant events, within a foreign country that can impact the services being provided by the 3rd party, ultimately affecting operations for Wally. Managing such risks can be extremely challenging and complex, especially when one considers the diverse political landscape in various regions around the globe. Legal issues also can pose significant country risks, as laws and regulations differ greatly from region to region.
7. Information Technology Risk. These are risks arising from any number of information technology and information security issues, such as inadequate IT resources along with lack of manpower. Additionally, risks can arise from abuse, misuse of information technology resources, while data breaches and security compromises can occur because of improperly designed networks, little to no information security policies, procedures, etc.

## Y.2.2 Vendor Risk Determination

The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats, and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.

* Step 1. Risk Probability
  * Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the chance that a risk will occur.
  * Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 2. Impact Analysis
  * Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from such a risk.
  * Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 3. Risk Level
  * Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the risk probability and impact analysis steps, a risk level is determined.
  * Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

## Y.3 Vendor Monitoring

Upon successfully approving all business agreements with vendors, management of Wally is to continuously monitor the various aspects of the outsourcing entity as it relates to aforementioned risks. Wally will, based on the determined risk level, conduct Vendor Selection and Vendor Risk Assessments at these intervals:

* Quarterly, when the risk level is high,
* Semi-annually, when the risk level is medium,
* Annually, when the risk level is low.
